# Star-Influencer-PatikaLastWork
 
> This project is the final assignment we did for the PATIKA bootcamp.

The character in our game aims to become an influencer by passing through decision gates and collecting emoji. Our score drops when we make wrong decisions about being an influencer. When we make the right decisions, our score increases. When the progress bar on the character is full, the character continues to become an influencer with a new concept, but if she loses points, she will go back to her old concept.
